Original OpenWPM Paper: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf

Steps to set up openWPN (MacOS):
1. Follow set up steps on openWPM readme
    1. ./install.sh
    2. conda activate OpenWPM (<— need conda if you don’t already have)
2. Install stuff
    1. Sudo pip3 install selenium
    2. Pip3 install dataclasses-json dill domain_utils bs4 psutil tblib multiprocess easyprocess pyvirtualdisplay tabulate jsonschema sentry_sdk
3. Download/update Firefox
4. Python3 -m demo (runs demo.py)

OpenWPM docs: https://openwpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To run:
python3 -m dp_crawl
python3 -m dp_analysis

To edit:
- dp_crawl.py: change the urls of sites we want to crawl 
- dp_customer_command.py: change commands called during crawl
- dp_analysis.py: change analysis/report

Resources for making Firefox extension: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

General Approach:
- On webpage load, pass url to dp_crawl and run (is there a way to do this in the background/without taking over their browser for a few seconds?)
- Then run dp_analysis
- Pass relevant results back and display on extension
